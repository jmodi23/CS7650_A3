Welcome to my readme.txt file for this Assignment 3!

GT EMAIL: JMODI30@GATECH.EDU

LANGUAGE: PYTHON
METHOD: JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS

The code for the entire project is written in a single file, to make it easier to process!
If you have Anaconda Navigator, all relevant libraries are already accessible and ready to use. If not, please take a look at the file labeled "pip-requirements-a3.txt" (thanks to Varun Dave for the idea). 

**To run the code**

The setup:
Each dataset must run through KMeans, Expectation Maximization via Gaussian Mixtures, PCA, ICA, RCA via Gaussian Random Projections, and t-SNE. More on those in the write-up. They will also go through neural networks that are trained on these dimension-reduced datasets, as well as the labels created by the clustering algorithms. 

Please set up an environment that supports .ipynb files. This could be Google Colab, Jupyter Notebooks, or the Anaconda Navigator environment. Then, on the top, clicks "Cells" > "Run All".

Code and all relevant graphs used in analysis can be found above. The link expires on January 3rd, 2024.

Because of the permitted usage of GenAI tools, I utilized ChatGPT to help answer questions about my datasets, as well as Sklearn's modules, and LaTex syntax for Overleaf. The link to my conversation is attached here: https://chat.openai.com/share/adb64648-e030-4d4f-9bd5-83e64d3faf60

Happy coding!
